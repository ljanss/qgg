<meta property="og:description" content="We have developed Genomic Feature Linear Mixed Models for predicting quantitative trait phenotypes from high resolution genomic polymorphism data. Genomic features are regions on the genome that are hypothesized to be enriched for causal variants affecting the trait. Several genomic feature classes can be formed based on previous studies and different sources of information including genes, chromosomes, biological pathways, gene ontologies, sequence annotation, prior QTL regions, or other types of external evidence. Using prior information on genomic features is important because prediction is difficult for populations of unrelated individuals when the number of causal variants is low relative to the total number of polymorphisms, and causal variants individually have small effects on the traits. The models were implemented using likelihood or Bayesian methods.
We have developed Genomic Feature Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GFBLUP) models. We have extended these models to include multiple features and multiple traits. Different genetic models (e.g. additive, dominance, gene by gene and gene by environment interactions) can be specified.
We have developed Bayesian multiple Genomic Feature and Trait models. The models are implemented using an empirical Bayesian method that handles multiple features and multiple traits. The models were implemented using spectral decomposition that plays an important computational role in the Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy. This is a very flexible and formal statistical framework for using prior information to decompose genomic (co)variances and predict trait phenotypes.
The premise of the Genomic Feature models presented above is that genomic features are enriched for causal variants affecting the traits. However, in reality, the number, location and effect sizes of the true causal variants in the genomic feature are unknown. Therefore we have developed and evaluated a number of SNP set tests derived from a standard Genomic BLUP model. These approaches are computationally very fast allowing us to rapidly analyze different layers of genomic feature classes to discover genomic features potentially enriched for causal variants.  Results from these analyses can be built into the above mentioned prediction models." />
