\description{
Bayesian Genomic Feature models implemented using Bayesian Methods. 
Multiple features and multiple traits models can be fitted.
Different genetic models (e.g. additive, dominance, gene by gene and gene by environment interactions) can be specified.
}
\details{
The models are implemented using empirical Bayesian methods. The hyperparameters of the dispersion parameters of the Bayesian model can
be obtained from prior information or estimated by maximum likelihood, and conditional on these, the model is fitted using
Markov chain Monte Carlo. Furthermore, a spectral decomposition of genomic feature relationship matrices plays an 
important computational role in the Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy implemented.
